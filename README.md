# Desktop for Chrome

## Data sources
Current weather information is from the OpenWeatherMap API. Calendar events are from the Google Calendar API and use the Google account of whoever is currently logged into Chrome. The world map and all logos for website icons are adapted from Wikimedia Commons (except for the Google Keep logo, which was recreated on Adobe Illustrator for this project).
